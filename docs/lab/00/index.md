# 00 - Introduction to Kotlin and Android Studio
## Setup
During the semester we will use the Android Studio IDE. For installing it please follow the [link](https://developer.android.com/studio) for downloading it.

If you want to solve the kotlin exercises without an IDE, use [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org).

## Why Kotlin?
Kotlin is a modern programming language that offers many mechanisms to ensure code security, as well as an easy syntax.

Kotlin offers the possibility of development on several platforms, being compatible with the JVM. At the same time, any library in Java can be used in a program written in Kotlin. The opposite is also true. Because of all this, it is considered that learning this language can also help you in the future, for your future projects.

## Base syntax
To start learning Kotlin, please follow all chapters of the following tutorial: [Kotlin Tour](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-welcome.html).
